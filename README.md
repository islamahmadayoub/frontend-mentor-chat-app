## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- **Bonus**: See the chat interface animate on the initial load, would be super awesome to have the typing effect added but perhaps in a future project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Intellij

### Continued development

I think I should have designed this Mobile-First as I found it a bit challenging to fit to mobile after desktop build. Should plan out the build before starting out. I should work more on Positioning and Responsive Layouts
